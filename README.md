# OLITA Digital Odyssey 2015: Consuming and Transforming Open Data - a hands-on tutorial
  
## Who are you?
I'm Mita Williams. I'm not a data librarian nor a map librarian.
  
## Where am I?
Good question. If I gave you directions here, I would tell you we are at 51 Dockside Dr, Toronto, ON M5A 1B6.  
  
But if I wanted to describe the location for a map, I might describe the same location using latitude and longitude:  
43° 38' 39.2706", -79° 21' 55.4508"  
  
I can described the same space using longitude and longitude using decimal degrees, instead of minutes and seconds"  
43.644242, -79.365403
