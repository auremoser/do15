# OLITA Digital Odyssey 2015: Consuming and Transforming Open Data - a hands-on tutorial
  
## Who are you?
I'm Mita Williams. I'm not a data librarian nor a map librarian.
  
## Where am I?
Good question. If I gave you directions here, I would tell you we are at 51 Dockside Dr, Toronto, ON M5A 1B6.  
  
But if I wanted to describe the location for a map, I might describe the same location using latitude and longitude:  
43° 38' 39.2706", -79° 21' 55.4508"  
You would read the above as "43 degrees, 38 minutes and 39.2706 seconds."
  
Its confusing to describe a place using minutes and seconds. So let's describe the same place using longitude and longitude but using decimal degrees instead of minutes and seconds.  
43.644242, -79.365403  
  
## What if I was the Toronto Public Library and I wanted to tell people where the 100 library branches the TPL are in the city? 
Well, you would probably make a map using Google Maps of all the TPL Library branches: http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/hours-locations/  

## How could I make this map?
